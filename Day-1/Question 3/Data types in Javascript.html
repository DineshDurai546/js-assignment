					<h1>Data types in Javascript</h1>
					<h3>Data, the name given to information, which is used by a computer, can come in several
different forms. For example, numbers, dates, and text.
<br>Some programming languages are strongly typed, which means that when a piece of data
is included in the program being written its data type must be declared first. The data
then must be treated according to strict rules which apply to that particular data type if
an error is not to be caused.<br></h3>
					<h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>
<h3>Primitive data types are number, string, boolean, NULL, Infinity and symbol. Non-primitive data types is the object. The JavaScript arrays and functions are also objects.</h3>
					
					
					
					
<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>
<h3>Fully featured languages such as Java and C++ have several different data types for
numbers that are used depending on its size and nature. The program then knows how
much memory to set aside for it.<br>
Note that while you can give JavaScript octal and hexadecimal
numbers to work with, it will always give back the result in decimal form. For example,
the following code
alert(10 + 10);
returns 20 as you would expect. But
alert(010 + 010);
will alert as 16. This is because octal 10 is equivalent to decimal 8, and eight plus eight
is 16 (remember it returns numbers in decimal form). For the same reason the following,
which adds hexadecimal 10 to hexadecimal 10 (decimal 16 to decimal 16) will alert
as 32.</h3></p>

<h2>Boolean</h2>

<h3>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.<br>
Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.
</h3>


<h2>String</h2>
<h3>  JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.<br>A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.<br>JavaScript code itself is written in text, without some means of distinguishing
between the text, which is code, and the text that is a string things could
become confusing. To solve this problem quote marks can be used to surround a line of
text or sequence of characters to indicate it is “not code.”</h3>
<h2>Undefined</h2>
<h3>Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.<br>var a;<br>
console.log(a); // This will return undefined.<br>
The variable ‘a’ has been declared but hasn’t been assigned a value yet.
We can assign a value to a:
</h3>

<h2>Null </h2>
<h3>  The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.</h3><br><br>





<h2 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Non-Primitive Data Types</h2>
<h3>The ‘object’ is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript. Arrays and Functions in JavaScript belong to the ‘object’ data type.</h3><br>

<h2 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Object</h2>
<h3>Let’s create an object literal. An object in JavaScript contains key-value pairs in its address. When we refer to obj1, we are actually referring to the address in memory which contains the value {a: 5, b: 6}, instead of the value {a: 5, b: 6} directly.</h3><br>

<h2 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Array</h2>
<h3>An array in JavaScript is an object data type. An array contains more than one value with a numerical index, where the index starts from 0. Thus it holds its value in a key-value pair.</h3><br>

<h2 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Function</h2>
<h3>JavaScript doesn’t have a function data type but when we find the data type of a function using the typeof operator, we find that it returns a function. This is because a function is an object in JavaScript. Ideally the data type of a function should return an object but instead, it returns a function. This is an error in JavaScript.</h3>
